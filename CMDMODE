- Command mode
---------------------

This is the grammar for the 'command mode' (your configuration file
uses these commands, too).

left  := <h> | <cursor-left>
right := <l> | <cursor-right>
up    := <j> | <cursor-up>
down  := <k> | <cursor-down>

where := <left|right|up|down> | <tag>
move  := <m>
snap  := <s>

cmd     := [ <times> ] [ <move> | <snap> ] <where>
with    := <w> { [ <times> ] <where> }+ <space> <cmd>
jump    := [ "<window class>[/<window title>]" | <workspace> [ <column> <row> ] ]
focus   := focus [ <times> | floating | tiling | ft ]
  (travels the focus stack backwards, <times> number of times (by default 1).
   So by specifying "focus 1" it selects the window which last had the focus
   before you focused the current one window.
   The following 3 special values are also valid:
    'floating' (select the next floating window).
      'tiling' (select the next tiling window).
          'ft' (toggle tiling/floating: if the current window is floating,
                select the next tiling window and vice-versa)
special := [ exec <path> | kill | exit | restart ]

input   := [ <cmd> | <with> | <jump> | <focus> | <special> ]

you can cancel command mode by pressing escape anytime.

Some examples:

Select the window on the left:
h

Select the window two places on the left:
2h

Move window to the right:
ml

Move window and window on the bottom to the right:
wk ml
