/*
 * To get the big concept: There are helper structures like struct Colorpixel
 * or struct Stack_Window. Everything which is also defined as type (see
 * forward definitions) is considered to be a major structure, thus important.
 *
 * Let’s start from the biggest to the smallest:
 *
 * - An i3Screen is a virtual screen (Xinerama). This can be a single one,
 *   though two monitors might be connected, if you’re running clone
 *   mode. There can also be multiple of them.
 *
 * - Each i3Screen contains Workspaces. The concept is known from various
 *   other window managers.  Basically, a workspace is a specific set of
 *   windows, usually grouped thematically (irc, www, work, …). You can switch
 *   between these.
 *
 * - Each Workspace has a table, which is our layout abstraction. You manage
 *   your windows by moving them around in your table. It grows as necessary.
 *
 * - Each cell of the table has a container, which can be in default or
 *   stacking mode. In default mode, each client is given equally much space
 *   in the container. In stacking mode, only one client is shown at a time,
 *   but all the titlebars are rendered at the top.
 *
 * - Inside the container are clients, which is X11-speak for a window.
