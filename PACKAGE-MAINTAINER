Dear package maintainer,

thanks for packaging i3. By doing so, you are improving your distribution
and i3 in general.

Please read the file DEPENDS now, so you know which libraries are necessary
and where to get them from if your distribution does not already have
packages for them.

Please make sure the manpage for i3 will be properly created and installed
in your package.

On debian, this looks like this:

	# Compilation
	$(MAKE)
	$(MAKE) -C man

	# Installation
	$(MAKE) DESTDIR=$(CURDIR)/debian/i3-wm/ install
	mkdir -p $(CURDIR)/debian/i3-wm/usr/share/man/man1
	cp man/i3.1 $(CURDIR)/debian/i3-wm/usr/share/man/man1

If you have any questions, ideas, hints, problems or whatever, please do not
hesitate to contact me. I will help you out. Just drop me an E-Mail (find the
address at http://michael.stapelberg.de/Kontakt, scroll down to bottom),
contact me using the same address in jabber or ask on our IRC channel:
(#i3 on irc.twice-irc.de).

Thanks again for your efforts,
Michael
