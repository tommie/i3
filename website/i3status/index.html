<h1>i3status</h1>

<p>
  i3status is a small program (less than 1000 SLOC) for generating a status bar
  for dzen2, xmobar or similar programs. It is designed to be very efficient by
  issuing a very small number of system calls, as one generally wants to update
  such a status line every second. This ensures that even under high load, your
  status bar is updated correctly. Also, it saves a bit of energy by not hogging
  your CPU as much as spawning the corresponding amount of shell commands would.
